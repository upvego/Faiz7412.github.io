A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/sol0mka/pen/yNOage.

 This is the second demo for my motion graphics library mo·js with v0.119.0.

My intention was to create a gallery of demos. Each bubble should have an icon to make the ability to interact with it obvious. Also content for each bubble should represent some project and not to be the dummy placeholder.

Thanks for watching! :D
